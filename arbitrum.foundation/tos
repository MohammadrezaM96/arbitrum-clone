Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</h3><h3 class="mb-2 font-semibold mt-6 text-base">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</h3><ol class="list-[lower-alpha]"><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</u><p>We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and The Arbitrum Foundation agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and The Arbitrum Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Exceptions.</u><p>As limited exceptions to Section 11(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</u><p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.</p><p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Arbitration Costs.</u><p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</u><p>Except as provided in Section 11(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Class Action Waiver.</u><p>YOU AND THE ARBITRUM FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p></li><li class="ml-10 mb-2"><u>Severability.</u><p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 11(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p></li></ol><h3 class="mb-2 font-semibold mt-6 text-base">12. General</h3><p class="mb-4">These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and The Arbitrum Foundation governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreements between you and The Arbitrum Foundation with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and The Arbitrum Foundation submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York, New York. The failure of The Arbitrum Foundation to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of The Arbitrum Foundation. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of The Arbitrum Foundation, but The Arbitrum Foundation may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. The Arbitrum Foundation will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond The Arbitrum Foundation’ reasonable control.</p><h3 class="mb-2 font-semibold mt-6 text-base">Questions?</h3><p class="mb-4">Please contact us at<!-- --> <a href="mailto:info@arbitrum.foundation">info@arbitrum.foundation</a> <!-- -->to report any violations of these Terms of Service or to pose any questions regarding these Terms of Service or the Service.</p></div></div></section><hr class="margin-top-xxlarge"/><footer><div class="l-Footer"><div class="l-Footer__links"><ul><li class="l-Footer__label">Learn More</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/">View Proposals</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226">Read the Vision</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.arbitrum.io/">Read Developer Docs</a></li></ul><ul><li class="l-Footer__label">Resources</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/">Blog</a></li><li><a href="tos">Terms of Service</a></li><li><a href="privacy">Privacy Notice</a></li></ul><ul><li class="l-Footer__label">Ecosystem</li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portal.arbitrum.io/">App Portal</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Bridge</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://research.arbitrum.io/">Research Forum</a></li></ul><ul><li class="l-Footer__label">Talk to us</li><li><a href="mailto:info@arbitrum.foundation">info@arbitrum.foundation</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/arbitrum">Discord</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="l-Footer__subscribe"><div><span class="l-Footer__label">Join the community</span><p class="l-Footer__subscribe-lede">Sign up to our newsletter for updates, announcements, and more.</p><iframe title="Form" src="embed/newsletter.html" width="100%"></iframe></div><button class="c-BackToTop mt-8">Back to top</button></div></div></footer></main><w3m-modal></w3m-modal></div><div class="[ l-Section l-Section--stars ]"><div class="stars-small"></div><div class="stars-big"></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/tos","query":{},"buildId":"0g30GtLm-T_bTu6M_VM4K","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body>
